# Patient-Triaging-with-Quantum-ML
This quantum computing-based solution helps in categorization of patients for emergency assessment and priority treatment within healthcare emergency department.

## Product Overview
Patient-Triaging-with-Quantum-ML is a hybrid quantum computing-based approach for categorizing patients' triage for emergency assessment and priority treatment. The solution leverages unsupervised machine learning approach and uses patient vitals to cluster them into categories and further labels the clusters into triage priorities. This solution improves risk assesment and empowers healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and enhance the overall quality of care.

## Product Highlight 

* The solution involves a novel approach to clustering by formulating as a constrained optimization problem and labeling the patients' triage clusters using a data-driven approach. This allows for better differentiation between categories of patients that require time-sensitive treatments, facilitating targeted interventions, reducing unnecessary delays, and optimizing resource allocation within healthcare systems. The use of quantum hybrid solvers reduces the time and space required to solve clustering problems and provides better quality results.
* This solution utilizes Dwave Leapâ„¢ quantum cloud service and provides solution using real-time access to  quantum computer and quantum hybrid solver service.
