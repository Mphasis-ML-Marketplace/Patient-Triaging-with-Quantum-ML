# Patient-Triaging-with-Quantum-ML
This quantum computing-based solution helps in categorization of patients for emergency assessment and priority treatment within healthcare emergency department.

## Product Overview
Patient-Triaging-with-Quantum-ML is a hybrid quantum computing-based approach for categorizing patients' triage for emergency assessment and priority treatment. The solution leverages unsupervised machine learning approach and uses patient vitals to cluster them into categories and further labels the clusters into triage priorities. This solution improves risk assesment and empowers healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and enhance the overall quality of care.

## Product Highlight 

* The solution uses a data driven approach to identify patients that require time-sensitive treatments, facilitating targeted interventions, reducing unnecessary delays, and optimizing resource allocation within healthcare systems.
* The solution uses quantum hybrid solvers from D-Wave to reduce the time and space required while providing better quality results.
