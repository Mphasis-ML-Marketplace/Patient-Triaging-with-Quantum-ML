    "# Patient Triaging with Quantum ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient Triaging is a hybrid quantum computing-based approach for categorizing patients' triage for emergency assessment and priority treatment. The solution leverages unsupervised machine learning approach and uses patient vitals to cluster them into categories and further labels the clusters into triage priorities. This solution improves risk assesment and empowers healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and enhance the overall quality of care.\n",
